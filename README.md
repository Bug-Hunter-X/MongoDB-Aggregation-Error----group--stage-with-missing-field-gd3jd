# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Handling Missing Fields in `$group`

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: using the `$group` stage with a field that might be missing in some documents.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The core issue stems from attempting to group documents based on a field that isn't guaranteed to exist in every document within the matching criteria.  This will result in an error during aggregation. The solution involves using the `$ifNull` operator to provide a default value for the field if it is missing, thereby preventing the error and ensuring a more robust aggregation process.
